### Fireworks

Welcome into my sweet diversion  
Tell me stories of love in your life  
And I am lost yet  
You claim I'm searching  
Quite what for  
I have yet to work out  
If I'm wrong  
And everything is wrong

Welcome into my sweet confusion  
Tell me stories of strength in your life  
And I am weak yet  
You claim I'm searching  
Quite what for  
I have yet to work out  
If I'm wrong  
And everything is wrong

Can I blame fireworks that  
Burn over your town
