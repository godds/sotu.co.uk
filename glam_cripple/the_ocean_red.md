### The Ocean Red

And I know I am still afraid  
Of hearing voices  
Rattle in my head

And I could simply free my veins  
Into the ocean  
An ocean turning red

You were all I had left today  
Can you pull me out of the waves  
And I am lost (when will you find me)  
And I am lost (when will you find me)  
And I am lost (when will you find me)  
And I am lost (when will you find me)
