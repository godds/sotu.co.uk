### Fuel To Burn

And everything seems fine  
Till you decide to  
Open your eyes

And I am so tired  
Of wanting destruction  
To fall on the world

It's all fuel for  
Man to burn

I will take out your eyes  
I will take out your eyes  
I will take out your eyes  
I will take out your eyes

Get outside  
Get outside  
Get outside  
Get outside

Get outside  
Get outside  
Get outside where  
The air, I know  
Is for the last time
