### Hatred

So how can I explain  
My desire to run away  
You don't understand  
Your creation  
You don't understand  
Your creation

And the hatred is rising  
But I hope that I'm stronger than this

You don't know  
You don't know this  
You don't know

You're waiting out on  
You're waiting out on  
You're waiting so far

And the hatred is rising  
But I hope that I'm stronger than this  
And the hatred is rising  
But I pray that I'm stronger than this

A saviour  
To save myself  
A saviour  
To save myself
