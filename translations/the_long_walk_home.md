### The Long Walk Home

Kiss me awake  
From this dream  
I am a soldier  
Dying unclean  
And I lost the battle  
I'm losing the war

Kiss me awake  
Into sleep  
I am the witness  
But I can't speak  
I really don't mind  
I really don't mind

Can I invite you down  
To this world  
Can I invite you down
