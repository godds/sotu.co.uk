### Zionist Timing

And they forgot  
To come around  
The saviours of  
The underground

I am alright  
I am alright without you here

So take us on  
We'll take you out  
I see your wars  
And live with them

I am alright  
I am alright without you here

And they forgot  
The common ground  
Shit, I forgot  
There isn't one

I am alright  
I am alright without you here

The end I, the end I know  
The end I, the end I know  
The end I, the end I know  
The end I, the end I know  
The end I, end I know  
End I, end I know
