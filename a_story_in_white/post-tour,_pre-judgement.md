### Post-Tour, Pre-Judgement

Don't you know where I've been  
I have climbed every mountain  
Don't you know what I've seen  
The earth, the sky, the moon above  
And in between I'll shine like you should have

In a way  
Without hate  
I wouldn't be what I am  
In a way  
Without hate  
I wouldn't be what I am

Don't you know what I've been  
Did I cause every tension  
But I want you to be  
The earth, the sky, the moon above  
And in between I'll shine like you should have

In a way  
Without hate  
I wouldn't be what I am  
In a way  
Without hate  
I wouldn't be what I am

Into a world I can do without  
Into a world I can do without

Undecided  
Should I pray to something else  
Undecided  
Should I pray to something else

Fuck the devil  
Fuck myself

Yes, one, two, three, bow  
One, two, three, bow  
One, two, three, bow  
Yes, one, two, three, bow  
One, two, three, bow  
Again, bow, bow, bow
