### The Question Is Complete

I hear your sweet words in stereo  
You halt my every running start

Say you will  
Say you will  
Say it sometimes

Say you will  
Say you will  
Say it sometimes  
I am nice  
I am nice

Your lack of faith  
Your lack of faith  
Is coming on

Your lack of faith  
In what I am  
You lack of faith is useless
