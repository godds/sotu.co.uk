### Hatred

And how can I explain  
My desire to run away  
You don't understand  
Your creation  
You don't understand  
Your creation

And the hatred is rising  
But I hope that I'm stronger than this

You don't know  
You don't know this  
You don't know

I promise I'll come out  
I promise I won't kill  
But I'm lost  
Very far  
Very far away

And the hatred is rising  
But I hope that I'm stronger than this  
And the hatred is rising  
But I hope that I'm stronger than this

A saviour  
To save myself  
A saviour  
To save myself
