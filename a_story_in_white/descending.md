### Descending

And one thing I fear is  
What I might lose  
A kiss on the mouth  
To remind me of you

Take it in turns to  
Decide where to go

I'm looking for something  
That God only knows

And am I yours  
On the way down  
Are you still calling me  
And how do I hear

And I'll turn my back  
And you turn around  
Coz you are still further  
Than I've ever found  
And I'll turn my back  
And you turn around  
Coz I am still further  
Than you've ever found

And am I yours  
On the way down  
Are you still calling me  
And how do I hear

And I'll turn my back  
And you turn around  
And I am still further  
Than you've ever found  
And you turn your back  
And I'll turn around  
And you are still further  
Than I've ever found  
Than I've ever found
