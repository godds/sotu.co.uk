### Sunday 3:52

When the lights go out  
I will be running  
Over your name

When the lights go out  
I will burn down  
This side of my life

Something beautiful  
Fell into my life  
Something beautiful  
Fell into my life

And your initial on postcard  
And your initial on the screen  
I demand your skin  
And I demand your skin  
I demand your skin  
Needing one chance

When the lights go out  
I will be running  
Over your name
