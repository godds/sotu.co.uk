### Barriers

I thought the fight was over  
All battles won  
I thought you'd lift your blindfold  
And watch them burn  
I thought that I could show you  
All that I've found  
These barriers dictate all sight and all sound

I found love in the loneliest places  
Places I shouldn't be found  
I found love in the home of a sinner  
Wrapped in some bitter sweet song  
So let me tell the truth  
Let me come alive  
Let me build bridges  
Into your life  
I'm sick of being born again and again  
I don't need conditions to let you in

Have you noticed how we talk  
And how we play our games  
A leather-bound appeal  
To change our ways  
All I wanted was to show you  
All that I've found  
No answers, no exits, no prophecy found

I found love in the loneliest places  
Places I shouldn't be found  
I found love in the home of a sinner  
Wrapped in some bitter sweet song  
So let me tell the truth  
Let me come alive  
Let me build bridges  
Into your life  
I'm sick of being born again and again  
I don't need conditions to let you in

I found love in the loneliest places  
Places I shouldn't be found  
I found love in the home of a sinner  
Wrapped in some bitter sweet song  
So let me tell the truth  
Let me come alive  
Let me build bridges  
Into you life  
I'm sick of being born again and again  
I don't need conditions to let you in

I never meant to hurt you  
Or drive you away  
The barriers we've built  
Looks like they're here to stay
