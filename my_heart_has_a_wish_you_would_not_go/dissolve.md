### Dissolve

So take a deep breath and let it go  
You know it's good for you and for us  
When you're ready let me know  
I'll contemplate the waste and the hurt  
I know the road now  
I know the road now

In our usual way  
We can celebrate life  
Raise a glass of wine  
Beat my consciousness down  
I'm ready to surrender  
I'm ready to dissolve  
I'm ready to surrender  
Lately I don't feel much at all  

So take a deep breath and let it go  
You know it's good for you and for her  
Even though you may be wrong  
You calculate the waste and the hurt  
I know the road now  
I know the road now

In our usual way  
We can celebrate life  
Raise a glass of wine  
Beat my consciousness down  
I'm ready to surrender  
I'm ready to dissolve  
I'm ready to surrender  
Lately I don't care much at all

So take a deep breath and let it go  
You know it's good for you
