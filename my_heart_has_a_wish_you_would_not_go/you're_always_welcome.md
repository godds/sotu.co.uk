### You're Always Welcome

The lights that come in and out of my life  
I'll write, I'll re-record these times  
The grill in the meadow  
The ex's disease  
Some passing of family  
Frustration released  
You have a home here  
You have a place to hide

You're always welcome  
And you're more than I can say

The night you showed me I could sing  
I praised the lord for drunken honesty  
A master of patience  
To put up with me  
Some surrogate brother I wanted to be  
You have a home here  
You have a place to hide

You're always welcome  
All this I know  
And you're more than I can show

May your days be golden  
Let it always surround you  
May your days be golden  
Let it always surround you  
May your days be golden  
Let it always surround you  
May your days be golden  
Let it always surround you
