### The Running Man

I lost my way in 87  
And turned my heart  
And thoughts to heaven  
Oh foolish boy  
What could you know  
Aged eleven  

I thought I was open  
But I was closed  
And I thought I had answers  
To show the world  
And I thought that the good light  
Would guide me home  
  
For thirteen years  
I hid away  
And waited out the final days  
But now there's time  
To live my life  
As it decays  
As it decays  
  
I thought I was open  
But I was closed  
I thought I had answers  
To show the world  
I thought that the good light  
Would guide me home  
But no  
  
I thought I was open  
But I was closed  
I thought I had answers  
To show the world  
I thought that the light  
Would guide me home  
But no
