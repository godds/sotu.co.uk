### A Life Worth Living

Oh sweet emptiness fill my cup  
Watch it overflow  
Let it flood my soul  
This silence that I know so well  
My only friend  
My bitterst opponent  
The loneliest isle

But I came here so  
I could let you go  
And I could cut you out  
So I can live  
A life worth living  
A life worth living  
A life worth living  
A life worth  
A life worth living  
A life worth living  
A life worth living  
A life worth
