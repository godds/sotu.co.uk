### Exits

It's not my choice to be here  
In this bitter little room
I've never found an exit  
and I doubt I'll find one soon  
I cursed you all for leaving  
Pushed you all away  
Oh how long will this last  
Will I stay

Won't you help me to find  
A way out  
Some exits  
A lifeline

But will I only come out  
To a bigger room  
And we've all got exits  
We keep on running to  
So grab yourself a bottle  
It's yours as much as mine  
We'll toast the air the sky  
And anything that we can't find  

Won't you help me find  
A way out  
Some exits  
A lifeline

With no way out  
And no way in 
I might not be needing this oxygen

With no way out  
And no way in 
I might not be needing this oxygen

With no way out  
And no way in 
I might not be needing this oxygen

With no way out  
And no way in 
I might not be needing this oxygen

With no way out  
And no way in 
I might not be needing this oxygen
 
With no way out  
And no way in 
I might not be needing this oxygen
