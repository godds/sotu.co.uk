### Exits

It's not my choice to be here  
There's been a little mood  
I've never found an exit  
and I doubt I'll find one soon  
I cursed you all for leaving  
Pushed you all away  
Oh how long will this last  
Will I stay

Won't you help me to find  
A way out  
Some exits  
A lifeline

But will I only come out  
To a bigger room  
And we've all got exits  
We keep on running to  
So grab yourself a bottle  
It's yours as much as mine  
We'll toast the air the sky  
And anything that we can't find  

Won't you help me find  
A way out  
Some exits  
A lifeline

There's no way out  
No way out  
Might not be needing this oxygen

There's no way out  
No way out  
Might not be needing this oxygen

There's no way out  
No way out  
Might not be needing this oxygen

There's no way out  
No way out  
Might not be needing this oxygen

There's no way out  
No way out  
Might not be needing this oxygen
 
There's no way out  
No way out  
Might not be needing this oxygen
