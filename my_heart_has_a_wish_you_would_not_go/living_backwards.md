### Living Backwards

I'm dead in the water  
A silhouette turning over  
I'll wait for you here

And I keep forgetting  
Where I'm meant to be  
Oh so far yet oh so near

So tell me  
Just what are these gifts that you bring  
This life is amazing  
But the colours keep changing  
And I'm sure  
We shouldn't be wasting away  
My rotting history  
Will find it's place

So don't go  
So cold  
So don't go  
So cold

I'll not be afraid  
It's taken this long  
To come back again  
And yes, I might suffer  
The fate of another  
The shit and the bones  
All things considered  
I walked with my hands held out  
I walkted with my hands held out  
To you and all that's good

And I'm sure  
We shouldn't be wasting away  
And I'm sure  
We shouldn't be wasting away  
And I'm sure  
We shouldn't be wasting away  
And I'm sure  
We shouldn't be wasting away

Living backwards  
I'm living backwards  
I'm living backwards  
I'm living backwards  
I'm living backwards  
I'm living backwards
