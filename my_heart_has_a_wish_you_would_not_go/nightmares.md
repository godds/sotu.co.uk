### Nightmares

Nightmares on route to Dallas  
Born out of one bad habbit  
One filled with lust and fire  
Unconcious dark desire  
One riddled with guilt again  
To shame our family name  
My head is caving in

And now  
Only love can save me now  
Only love can save me now

This rotting mouth and faded memory  
This self-inflicted awful injury  
Leads to a vengeful heart  
Which tears won't break apart  
My head is caving in  
My head is caving in  
My head is caving in at last  

And now  
Only love can save me now  
Only love can save me now  
Only love can save me now  
Only love can save me now
