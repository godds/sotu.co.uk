### Finding A Light

Maybe it's strange  
I've barely made a sound for 24 hours  
What's to say  
The poison inside is useless to everyone

But I know one day I'll find a new light  
And I'll take the sickness and bury it down  
Every moment, every second should be precious understand  
That I don't know how to live at all

And maybe I'll change  
Start a sick cult on a mysterious island  
Run away and tell the whole world  
There's amber in all of us

But I know one day I'll find a new light  
And I'll take the sickness and bury it down  
Every moment, every second should be precious understand  
That I don't know how to live without you  
Without you
