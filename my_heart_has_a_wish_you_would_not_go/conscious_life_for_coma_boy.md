### Conscious Life For Coma Boy

A potent mix of wonder  
Ignorance and fear  
A place to hide under  
A secret place to keep  
Self-serving answers  
Paper-thin belief  
Come bury your soul with me

I know I'd like  
A concious life  
I don't know how to get there  
I don't know hot to get there  
So keep me right  
We're wasting time  
I don't know how to get there  
I dont know how

Awaken  
Stand up to fight  
For all you've yet to know  
Coma boy

A bloated rich endeavour  
Unnecessary care  
Something I should bury  
Or something I should share  
Listen for doubtful ramblings  
And you'll find me there  
Come bury your soul with me

I know I'd like  
A conscious life  
I don't know how to get there  
I don't know how to get there  
So keep me right  
We're wasting time  
I don't know how to get there  
I don't know how

Awaken  
Stand up to fight  
For all you've yet to know  
Coma boy

It's not something  
To love or hate  
But don't you dare go throw it away  
May you be all you can be  
Coma boy
