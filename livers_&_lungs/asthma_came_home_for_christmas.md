### Asthma Came Home For Christmas

Paint the sky  
Take my skin  
My holy one  
There's worse to come

I suffocate  
Breathing air  
My only one  
Am I the one  
Who will be with you

To fall, to fall back into place  
But how do I belong

Watch and wait  
Take your time  
My distant one  
Will you come

This oxygen  
Is denied  
By closest one  
On your side  
I want to be with you

Oh, to fall, to fall back into place  
But how do I belong here, here

I'll wait for you here  
I'll wait for you here  
I'll wait for you here  
I'll wait for you here  
I'll wait for you here  
I'll wait for you here
