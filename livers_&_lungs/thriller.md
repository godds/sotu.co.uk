### Thriller

It's close to midnight  
Something evil's lurking in the dark  
Under the moonlight  
You see a sight that almost stops your heart

You try to scream  
But terror takes the sound before you make it  
You start to freeze  
As horror looks you right between the eyes  
You're paralyzed

This is thriller, thriller night  
And no-ones going to save you from the beast about to strike  
It's thriller, thriller night  
You're fighting for your life inside a killer thriller tonight

Night creatures call  
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade  
There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time  
This is the end of your life

They're out to get you  
There's demons closing in on every side  
They will possess you  
Unless you change that number on your dial

Now is it time  
For you and I to cuddle close together  
All through the night  
I'll save you from the terrors on the screen  
I'll make you see

It's thriller, thriller night  
'Cause I can throw more than any ghoul would rather dare try  
It's thriller, thriller night  
So let me hold you tight and share a killer chiller tonight

Darkness falls across the land  
The midnight hour is close at hand  
Creatures crawl in search of blood  
To terrorise your neighbourhood  
And whosoever shall be found  
Without the soul for getting down  
Must stand and face the hounds of hell  
And rot inside a corpse's shell  
The foulest stench is in the air  
The funk of fourty thousand years  
And grizzly ghouls from every tomb  
Are closing in to seal your doom  
And though you fight to stay alive  
Your body starts to shiver  
For no mere mortal can resist  
The evil of the thriller
