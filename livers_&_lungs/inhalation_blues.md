### Inhalation Blues

Half smoked my cigarettes  
Legs full of lead  
Suspiria, Static  
Dawn of the dead  
Remind me of you  
Remind me of you  
Remind me of you  
Remind me of you

TV and lights are on  
But frightened to move  
With each inhalation  
I'm scared that I will lose  
The memories of you  
Memories of you  
Memories of you  
The memories of you
