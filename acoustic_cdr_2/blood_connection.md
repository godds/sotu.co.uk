### Blood Connection

Am I a limb that you lost  
A limb you tried to save  
The one dissection that cost me my name

But I wouldn't have had anyone else  
To lead or light the way  
But that light got further and further away

Even though I am more than you know  
More than these tired dreams that you hold  
What did you think I'd be  
Some saint for all the world to see  
Born from perfect home  
Just let it go

You know I'm conscious of this  
Of when and what to say  
All these secrets can be a mistake

So come wade the past  
And why I ran away  
The one connection that conquers my hate
