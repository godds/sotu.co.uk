### Conscious Life

Potent mix of wonder  
Ignorance and fear  
A place to hide under  
A secret place to keep  
Self serving answers  
Paper-thin belief  
Bury your soul with me

I know I'd like  
A conscious life  
I don't know how to get there  
I don't know how to get there  
So keep me right  
We're wasting time  
I don't know how to get there  
I don't know how

Bloated rich endeavour  
Are necessary care  
There's something I should bury  
There's something I should share  
Listen for doubting ramblings  
And you'll find me there  
Bury your soul with me

I know I'd like  
A conscious life  
I don't know how to get there  
I don't know how to get there  
So keep me right  
We're wasting time  
I don't know how to get there  
I don't know how  
I don't know how  
I don't know how  
I don't know how  
I don't know how
