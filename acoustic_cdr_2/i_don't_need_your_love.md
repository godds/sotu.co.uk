### I Don't Need Your Love

Honestly  
We shoudn't be  
Here

Honestly  
We shouldn't be  
Here

We should be dancing  
We should be friends  
Celebrate our victories  
All over

Only time will tell  
Maybe time will tell

But I know  
I don't need your love  
I don't need your conscience  
To base my life upon

Your cotton mouth and sores  
Your blistered mind will know  
All and nothing  
All and nothing

So pleased  
Glad that you made it  
So pleased  
Glad that you called  
So pleased  
Is this what you wanted  
After all

So pleased  
Glad that you made it  
So pleased  
Glad that you called  
So pleased  
Is this what you wanted  
After all
