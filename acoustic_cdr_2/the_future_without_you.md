### The Future Without You

The future without you  
Is better that way  
You took the prize of glory and throw it away  
Thanks for the message   
Of wealth on display   
You deserve this rotten industry

So take your words and  
Take all your rocks  
Take all you wanted  
This is such a perfect place to be  
But a useless life to lead

Calm slick demeanor  
With slivers of shame  
You're not somebody  
You're only a name  
'Cause that's what's been given  
That's what been played  
They'll all be coming to take it away

So take your words and  
Take all your rocks  
Take all you wanted  
This is such a perfect place to be  
But a useless life to lead
