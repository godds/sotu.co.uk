Dance to sounds of India  
Halt this poisoned river  
All the love in your hands  
Could be mine forever

Taking it slowly now  
I'm coming up and  
I'm weaker than you know

And maybe wiser  
I'm old enough to  
Save something

Save, something  
Save, something, pure  
Save, something  
Save, something, pure
