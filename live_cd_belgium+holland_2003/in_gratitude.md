### In Gratitude

It is dangerous  
To put this into words  
But I'm alright  
Close to fulfilment  
I miss you  
I miss you

And anyway  
I just wanted to show you  
I'm yours now  
Empty and cynical  
Lost  
In gratitude  
In gratitude

It is dangerous  
To put into words  
But I know in time  
We'll get out of this mess  
We'll get out of this mess

And anyway  
I just wanted to show you  
Some happiness  
I wanted to show you the stars  
I want to show you the stars  
And we go

Just hit the ground running  
Just hit the ground running, I know  
Just hit the ground running  
And don't look back

Just hit the ground running  
Just hit the ground running  
Just hit the ground running  
And don't look back

Just hit the ground running  
Just hit the ground running, I know  
Just hit the ground running  
And don't look back
