### Yes

Shit! Now you're only one hour away  
Not that that matters when I  
Couldn't stay  
Yes sir, we were almost in line  
Blinded I was  
Yet I took my time

It's beautiful  
And it's beautiful

Your hair is on fire  
You lips are unscathed  
These people are nothing  
And I'm not alone

Shit! Now you're only one hour away
