### No Really, Everything's Fine

The reason we're all disfigured  
I will say it again  
The reason we're all disappointed  
With innocence lost  
You're alone  
You can feel the resentment  
Burning a pathway  
Straight to your heart  
I say kingdom come

Maybe your life is wonderful  
I wish you well  
Please understand I won't change you  
So grant me the same  
I know this  
There's a plain white horizon  
I want it so badly  
It seems after all  
That your will be done

And it's done  
Reaching out  
And it's done

We are all defenceless now  
On your own you left somehow  
With these broken bones  
These broken bones

But I am one with these chains  
Come around and I regain  
With my broken bones  
My broken bones

The reason we're all disfigured  
I will say it again  
The reason we're all disappointed  
With innocence lost  
You're alone  
You can feel the resentment  
Burning a pathway  
Straight to your heart  
I say kingdom come
