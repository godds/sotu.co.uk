### A Winter's Discord

Finally I have had enough  
Just one last journey to your island  
Where there's no peace  
And some kind of useless love  
Wrapped in a lesson  
That I'll never know

One last chance to hide upstairs  
To watch the tail-lights from the window  
Maybe I'm wrong  
Maybe I've always been  
Stronger to question  
All I held as true

I see more than this  
See more than this  
See more than this  
Black isle  
Black isle above  
Black isle above  
Black isle above me

Better free than saved and alone  
Better free than saved and alone  
But I'm always unfit to go  
But I'm always unfit to go
