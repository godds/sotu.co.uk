### Black Path

It's time to follow the black path  
And come tommorow you won't laugh at love  
Faced down you can see the ground turn  
From green and red, black to grey  
Where everyone becomes afraid of you

To find your journey on the black path  
The darkest Sunday from your own past  
Right now, I can see the ground turn  
From green and red, black to grey  
Where everyone becomes afraid of you

Of you  
Of you  
Of you  
Of you  
Of you  
Of you  
Of you

See how lifeless life can be  
See how lifeless life can be  
See how lifeless life can be  
See how lifeless life can be

We'll bury well  
We'll bury well  
We'll bury well  
We'll bury well  
We'll bury well  
We'll bury well  
We'll bury well  
We'll bury well
