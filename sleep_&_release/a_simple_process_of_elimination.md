### A Simple Process Of Elimination

Calling for penance  
Cracks in the hands of a stranger  
Are asking me to come back  
A call for deliverance  
Ghosts in the air that we breath  
Watching our every last word

We speak  
We speak

So what should I do  
About a boy  
Who won't listen

Erase  
Erase us  
Erase this world

A call for penance  
Crack in the hands of a stranger  
Are calling me home  
Sheer disobediance  
Simply a lack of love  
I'm warming up  
To come home  
To come home

So what should I do  
About a boy  
Who won't listen

So anxious to find  
Any other way  
But won't listen, no

Erase  
Erase us  
Erase this world

Erase  
Erase us  
Erase this world
