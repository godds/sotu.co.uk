### Motion

So how should I surround you  
And how should I relax  
It's happening now  
It's happening now

It's all in motion now  
We are in motion now  
God, I hope, we are in motion now  
It's all I ever wanted

So how should I embrace you  
And how should I come back  
I'm concious now  
I'm concious now

It's all in motion now  
We are in motion now  
God, I hope, we are in motion now  
It's all I ever wanted
