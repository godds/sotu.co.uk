### The Art Of Belief

Are you opening up tonight  
Will you share a drink  
And laughter while I try

I am weak at the thought of you  
I am weak at the thought of you

I was hoping we'd hold up the part  
Take a picture and keep it  
To remember I loved you that night

I am weak at the thought of you  
I am weak at the thought of you

Are you opening up tonight  
Will you share a drink  
And laughter while I try
