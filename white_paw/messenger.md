### Messenger

I'm glad that you came down with me  
I'm glad we recalled our history well  
Didn't we know the same  
God, I hope  
We're not safe for evil

So when does the message come  
And when do they tear my sweet dreams down  
I need you there to help me crawl  
I am not safe for evil

So when does the message come  
And when do they tear my sweet dreams down  
I need you there to help me crawl  
I am not safe for evil
