### Trenches

Well, we've been building our trenches  
Waiting alone  
For some hint or suggestion  
Of better things to come  
So listen, listen, please  
I won't wait any more

Let me run through the water  
Let me drink in the sea  
Let me run through the water  
Just to pick me up again  
Taking hold of our senses  
We can always be  
Anything that you wanted

You know that I love you  
But I can't let go  
You know that I love you  
But I can't let go  
May you always be  
May you always be  
May you always be  
May you always be  
Loved  
Loved

If I don't make it out  
Remember the love we had  
If I don't make it out  
Remember the love we had  
If I don't make it out  
Remember the love we had  
If I don't make it out  
Remember the love we had

I'm always yours  
I'm always yours  
I'm always yours  
I'm always yours
