### Barriers

I thought the fight was over  
All battles won  
I thought you'd lit your blindfolds  
Watch them burn  
I thought that I could show you  
All that I've found  
But barriers dictate all sight and all sound

I found love in the loneliest places  
Places I shouldn't have found  
I found love in the home of a sinner  
Wrapped in some bitter sweet song  
Let me tell the truth  
Let me come alive  
Let me build bridges into your life  
I'm sick of being torn  
Again and again  
I don't need permission to let you in

You noticed how we talk and how  
We play our games  
Leather bound appeal to  
Change our ways  
All I wanted was to show you  
All that I've found  
No exits, no answers, no prophecy bound

But I found love in the loneliest places  
Places I shouldn't have found  
I found love in the home of a sinner  
Wrapped in some bitter sweet song  
Oh, let me tell the truth  
And let me come alive  
Let me build bridges into your life  
I'm sick of being torn again and again  
I don't need conditions to let you in

I never meant to hurt you or  
Drive you away  
The barriers we've built, looks like there  
Here to stay
