### In Gratitude

It is dangerous  
To put this into words  
But I'm alright  
Close to fulfilment  
I miss you  
I miss you

Anyway  
I just wanted to show you  
I'm yours now  
Empty and cynical  
Lost  
In gratitude  
In gratitude

It is dangerous  
To put into words  
But I know in time  
We'll get out of this mess  
We'll get out of this mess

But anyway  
I just wanted to show you  
Some happiness  
I wanted to show you the stars  
I want to show you the stars  
And we'll go

Lets hit the ground running  
We'll hit the ground running, I know  
We'll hit the ground running  
And won't look back

Lets hit the ground running  
We'll hit the ground running  
We'll hit the ground running  
And won't look back
