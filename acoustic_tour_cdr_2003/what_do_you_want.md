### What Do You Want

So what do you want  
Some life if from hero (?)  
Well it won't come  
So take yourself ...

Maybe rise and start the process  
Help somebody else  
I know that in time  
We'll resurrect the circle  
You know we won't have won

Consider your faith  
You won't be moving mountains  
That's ok  
The mountains don't need friends

What you need  
Are open eyes and  
Open hands to give  
Anything to make the smallest difference  
You know we won't have love
