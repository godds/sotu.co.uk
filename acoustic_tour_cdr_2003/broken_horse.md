### Broken Horse

Broken horse lay on the ground  
There is still love for you now  
Broken horse form in the clouds  
There is still hope for you now

Broken horse sickness bound  
There is still warmth in the house  
Patience and strength for you heart  
For there is no easy way out

So break the walls that surround  
There are stars in the air that surround us  
But I know what I've found  
You're the only one left to hold on to  
And I love you

So break the walls that surround  
There are stars in the air that surround us  
But I know what I've found  
You're the only one left to hold on to  
And I love you
