### Remember

Take a deep breath and let it go   
You know it's good for you   
And for us

When you're ready let me know   
Contemplate the ways  
And the hurt  

We're on the road now  
We're on the road now

In our usual way  
We can celebrate life   
Raise a glass of wine  
Beat my consciousness down

I'm ready to surrender  
I'm ready to dissolve  
I'm ready to surrender  
Lately I don't feel much at all

Take a deep breath and let it go  
You know it's good for you  
And for us

When you're ready let me know  
Contemplate the ways  
And the hurt
