### Inkwell

Could I want you  
More than I remember  
A good sign I hope  
Emotion on loan

Curse my lack of self  
My lack of patience  
I know we'll be fine  
I hope that I'm right

If this isn't love  
Then what have I been searching for  
A calm empty mind  
Is something that I'll never find  
Or need to define

So it seems  
I can't control this fever  
The carousel mind  
Some trouble to fight

Humbled, call us one I'll call you Inkwell  
My long suffering muse  
I better not shout about it

If this isn't love  
Then what have I been searching for  
A calm empty mind  
Something that I'll never find  
Or need to define  
To define

See how they run about  
See how they rise  
See how they run about  
See how they rise

If this isn't love  
Then what have I been searching for  
A calm empty mind  
There's something that I'll never find  
Or need to define
