### The Unravelling

(Wait) wait  
(Wait) wait  
(Wait) Wait  
I feel it unravelling  
It comes with no warning at all  
And takes me over  
All words fail  
I'll fight it another day  
I'll fight it another day  
Let that day come

And ot cripples all thought  
It will hit you in waves  
It freezes all life  
And swallows the day  
I'll look for love  
Look for reason  
I'll look for anything  
I can believe in

Wait  
Wait  
I can hear thunder  
Wait  
Wait  
It's all around  
Wait  
Wait  
I can hear thunder  
I'll bring it down  
I'll bring it home  
I'll suck the life out  
I'll break the bones  
Blood from the stone  
Blood from the stone  
Blood from the stone  
Blood from the stone  
Blood from the stone  
Blood from the stone  
Blood from the stone  
Blood from the stone  
I'll take you on
