### Lightning Strikes The Postman

I got your letter  
It turned to sand  
Lightning strikes the postman  
In his hand  
I hope that you remember  
The things you had to say  
It's just a supernatural delay

I got your package  
It's all a mess  
Lightning strikes the postman  
In his chest  
I hope that your remember  
The things you had to say  
It's just a supernatural delay

Sent you a postcard  
Hope to find  
Lightning strikes the postman  
All the time  
I couldn't really think of  
Anything to say  
It's just a supernatural delay

It's hard to read the writing through the flame
