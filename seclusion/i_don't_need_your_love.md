### I Don't Need Your Love

Honestly  
We shoudn't be  
Here

Honestly  
We shouldn't be  
Here

We should be dancing  
We should be friends  
Celebrate our victory  
All over

Maybe time will tell  
Only time will tell

But I know  
I don't need your love  
I don't need your conscience  
To base my life upon

Your cotton mouth and sores   
Your blistered tongue will know  
All and nothing  
All and nothing

So please  
Glad that you made it  
So please  
Glad that you called  
So please  
Is this what you wanted  
After all (go home)

So please  
Glad that you made it  
So please  
Glad that you called  
So please  
Is this what you wanted  
After all (go home)
