### Dreams And Bridges

No, don't go  
There are still dreams and bridges to burn  
And you'll know  
The lessons I still have to learn

Always you  
Your lies  
Your bitterness  
Always you  
Your lies  
Your bitterness  
Always you  
Your life  
Your ignorance  
Always you and  
Your useless  
Disguise

So, you sold  
Your paralised view to the world  
Now behold  
This victor with nothing to hold

Always you  
Your lies  
Your bitterness  
Always you  
Your lies  
Your bitterness  
Always you  
Your life  
Your ignorance  
Always you and  
Your useless  
Disguise
