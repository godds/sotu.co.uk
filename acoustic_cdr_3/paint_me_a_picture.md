### Paint Me A Picture

Paint me a picture  
A picture of hope  
A snow-coated valley  
To watch from the window  
And how long to go  
I will return  
I have never forgotten  
Your face  
My heart nearly broke  
When I left you that day

I'm so cold and I  
Don't know which way to turn  
Will you wait for me  
I'm coming home

Paint me a picture  
A picture of home  
A burning horizon  
To watch from the window  
I know there is hope  
Paint me, embrace me  
In your heart forever  
By the way  
There is something that  
I've always wanted to say

I'm so cold and I  
Don't know which way to turn  
Will you wait for me  
I'm coming home
