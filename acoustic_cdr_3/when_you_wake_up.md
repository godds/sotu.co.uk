### When You Wake Up

Sleep now, leave your life behind  
Obey the ocean  
Surrender to the tide  
Find some shelter from the storm  
The moonlit ways become your own  
You find me waiting  
You find me waiting when you wake up  
When you wake up  
When you rise  
I've seen you wake a thousand times  
From wrestling with your dreams

Sleep now, leave this world behind  
Swim forever  
Find a place to hide  
Dig yourself into the sand  
I hope you know and understand  
You'll find me waiting  
You'll find me waiting when you wake up  
When you wake up  
When you rise  
I've seen you wake a thousand times  
From wrestling with your dreams
